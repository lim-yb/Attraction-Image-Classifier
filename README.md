# Singapore Attractions Image Classifier

This project explores the use of Tranfer Learning with EfficientNetB7 model to classify images of 4 iconic tourist attractions in Singapore:
- Gardens by the Bay
- Changi Jewel
- Marina Bay Sands
- Merlion

**Model Prediction of Attraction Class based on Image of Attraction:**\

## Techniques
- Deep Learning Framework (TensorFlow)
- Image Data Augmentation for Small Datasets
- Image Classification using Transfer Learning (EfficientNetB7 Model)
- Fine Tuning of Transfer Learning Model
- Early Stopping & Model Checkpoint Callbacks

## Future Roadmap

- Extract Larger Image Dataset for Model Training
