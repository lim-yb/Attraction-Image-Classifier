# Singapore Attractions Image Classifier

This project explores the use of Transfer Learning with EfficientNetB7 model, a Convolution Neural Network (CNN), to classify images of 4 iconic tourist attractions in Singapore.
- Gardens by the Bay
- Changi Jewel
- Marina Bay Sands
- Merlion

The Attraction Image Classifier is built upon EfficientNetB7 model as the feature extractor, a Dense layer at the top with 4 output neurons to record the prediction probabilities of each class, and further fine tuning is applied to EfficientNetB7 to specialise the base model towards classification of Attraction images. 

**Model Prediction of Attraction Class with Input Image:**

By inputting an image into the Classfier, the model will return prediction probabilities for each class, the prediction probabilities indicate the likelihood the input image is from the Attraction class.
